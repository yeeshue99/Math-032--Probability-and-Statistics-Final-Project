Parkinson's data set
Description of variables:

1. subject# - Integer that uniquely identifies each subject
2. age - Subject age
3. sex - Subject gender '0' - male, '1' - female
4. test_time - Time since recruitment into the trial. The integer part is the number of days since recruitment.
5. motor_UPDRS - Clinician's motor UPDRS score, linearly interpolated

7. Jitter(%)
8. Jitter(Abs)
9. Jitter:RAP
10. Jitter:PPQ5
11. Jitter:DDP - Several measures of variation in fundamental frequency

12. Shimmer
13. Shimmer(dB)
14. Shimmer:APQ3
15. Shimmer:APQ5
16. Shimmer:APQ11
17. Shimmer:DDA - Several measures of variation in amplitude

18. NHR
19. HNR - Two measures of ratio of noise to tonal components in the voice

20. RPDE - A nonlinear dynamical complexity measure
21. DFA - Signal fractal scaling exponent
22. PPE - A nonlinear measure of fundamental frequency variation
